""" State machine for a cursor-based center-out, out-center behavioral task, 
    with an imposed delay period after the first hold.

The `Machine` class defines a [pytransitions] state machine for a cursor task.

The task requires a cursor to engage a target in three-dimensional space, by 
moving to it and holding in position for a period of time. In each trial of the 
task, targets are first presented at a central "home" position, and then at a 
peripheral or "outer" position. To complete a trial successfully, a user must 
move to each of these targets, hold at each, and then return to the home 
position. A delay is imposed after the first hold, during which a cue appears 
at what will subsequently be the position of the outer target. The user is 
expected to continue holding at the home target during the delay.

Examples
--------

For this example, suppress event logging for the sake of legibility.

>>> Machine.log_event = lambda s, d: None

Create a state machine, using the default arguments.

>>> machine = Machine()
>>> machine.state
'inactive'

Create a convenient function for triggering events and reporting the state. 
This is useful for simplifying the code in the examples that follow.

>>> def trigger(state): return getattr(machine.model, state)()

Start a block of trials.

>>> success = trigger('start_block')
State: intertrial

Once a block has started, the state machine is placed in the `intertrial` 
state. In general, a `start_trial` event must then be triggered manually, in 
order to start a trial. However, for this state machine, we've also defined a 
`timeout` trigger, such that the `intertrial` state can be configured to 
automatically transition to a new trial, after a brief delay.

A trial consists of a setup state, a series of task-specific trial states, and 
a teardown state. The `start_trial` event will cause the state machine to 
transition to the `trial_setup` state. This state exists only for the purpose 
of implementing actions or behaviors that are necessary for preparing a trial. 
It is expected that the model transition callbacks for this state will also 
trigger a manual transition to the first state in the trial sequence, which is 
task-specific. For this example, the first trial state is `hold_a`. Similarly, 
the final trial states -- which are almost always the `success` or `failure` 
states -- should transition to the `trial_teardown` state, which is intended 
for implementing post-trial housekeeping actions. This state should manually 
transition to the `intertrial` state (e.g., via the `end_trial` event).

Step through the state sequence for a successful trial.

>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: trial_setup
>>> success = machine.model.to_move_a()  # Manual transition to trial state 1.
State: move_a
>>> success = trigger('target_engaged')
State: hold_a
>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: delay_a
>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: move_b
>>> success = trigger('target_engaged')
State: hold_b
>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: move_c
>>> success = trigger('target_engaged')
State: hold_c
>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: success
>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: trial_teardown
>>> success = trigger('end_trial')
State: intertrial

Step through the state sequence of a trial that fails during the `hold_c` phase.

>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: trial_setup
>>> success = machine.model.to_move_a()  # Manual transition to trial state 1.
State: move_a
>>> success = trigger('target_engaged')
State: hold_a
>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: delay_a
>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: move_b
>>> success = trigger('target_engaged')
State: hold_b
>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: move_c
>>> success = trigger('target_engaged')
State: hold_c
>>> success = trigger('target_disengaged')
State: failure
>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: trial_teardown
>>> success = trigger('end_trial')
State: intertrial

Step through the state sequence of a trial that fails during the `move_c` phase.

>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: trial_setup
>>> success = machine.model.to_move_a()  # Manual transition to trial state 1.
State: move_a
>>> success = trigger('target_engaged')
State: hold_a
>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: delay_a

>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: move_c
>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: failure
>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: trial_teardown
>>> success = trigger('end_trial')
State: intertrial

Step through the state sequence of a trial that fails during the `hold_b` phase.

>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: trial_setup
>>> success = machine.model.to_move_a()  # Manual transition to trial state 1.
State: move_a
>>> success = trigger('target_engaged')
State: hold_a

State: delay_a
>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: move_b
>>> success = trigger('target_engaged')
State: hold_b
>>> success = trigger('target_disengaged')
State: failure
>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: trial_teardown
>>> success = trigger('end_trial')
State: intertrial

Step through the state sequence of a trial that fails during the `move_b` phase.

>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: trial_setup
>>> success = machine.model.to_move_a()  # Manual transition to trial state 1.
State: move_a
>>> success = trigger('target_engaged')
State: hold_a
>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: delay_a
>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: move_b
>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: failure
>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: trial_teardown
>>> success = trigger('end_trial')
State: intertrial

Step through the state sequence of a trial that fails during the `delay_a` 
phase.

>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: trial_setup
>>> success = machine.model.to_move_a()  # Manual transition to trial state 1.
State: move_a
>>> success = trigger('target_engaged')
State: hold_a
>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: delay_a
>>> success = trigger('target_disengaged')
State: failure
>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: trial_teardown
>>> success = trigger('end_trial')
State: intertrial

Step through the state sequence of a trial that fails during the initial 
`hold_a` phase.

>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: trial_setup
>>> success = machine.model.to_move_a()  # Manual transition to trial state 1.
State: move_a
>>> success = trigger('target_engaged')
State: hold_a
>>> success = trigger('target_disengaged')
State: failure
>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: trial_teardown
>>> success = trigger('end_trial')
State: intertrial

Step through the state sequence of a trial that fails because it never engages 
with the target.

>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: trial_setup
>>> success = machine.model.to_move_a()  # Manual transition to trial state 1.
State: move_a
>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: failure
>>> success = trigger('timeout')
State: trial_teardown
>>> success = trigger('end_trial')
State: intertrial

Terminate the block of trials.

>>> success = trigger('end_block')
State: inactive
